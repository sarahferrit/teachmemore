    "text": "I was hired by Boston Harbor Now (BHN) to work on this project for 10 weeks during Summer 2025 as a Planning and Policy Fellow through the Harvard Graduate School of Design Community Service Fellowship Program. The results of my work include this website including an interactive map of existing and recommended climate-related programs along the Boston Harborwalk.\nThis map was created using found data (flood risk, EJ populations, water areas, Harborwalk) and created layers (existing and recommended climate programs). Sources for the found data are listed below. To catalog the existing climate programs shown, I spoke with BHN and partner staff, conducted desktop research, and visited approximately 18 miles of the Harborwalk. To recommend additional programs, I drew inspiration from BHN staff and other cities and programs, made field observations, and conducted a public survey reaching 105 people (as of August 2025).\nI built this website in RStudio using Quarto markdown and it is hosted on my personal GitHub site.\n\nSources\nDefinitions:\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Boston Harborwalk spans 43 miles of the City’s coastline, across several neighborhoods which are all vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate including increased heat and flooding. The Harborwalk itself serves as the edge between communities constructed on tidelands and the Boston Harbor, often making this public pathway the first line of defense against coastal flooding during high tides and storm surges.\nWith climate concerns becoming more pressing, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the existing climate-related educational programming already underway along the Harborwalk and to identify potential future engagement opportunities. Recommendations for additional climate education programs, activities, and materials prioritize locations and topics that are environmentally and socially relevant for residents and visitors of the Boston Harbor waterfront.\n\n\nMap\nThe following interactive map displays existing and recommended climate-related educational programming along the Boston Harborwalk. This tool may be used by Boston Harbor Now to help guide future programming efforts. Zoom in and out and click on points or polygons to see details about the features. Toggle layers on or off as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Term Definitions\nClimate programming - events, activities, or materials that cover topics related to climate change like increasing heat, storms, and sea level rise.\nEducational signage - sign or 2-dimensional display with text, graphics, and/or images that intend to educate the general public about a climate-related topic.\nExisting programming - events, activities, or materials that are currently ongoing or installed, or that took place or are planned to take place in the 2025 calendar year (as of July).\nEnvironmental Justice (EJ) communities - US Census tracts where the population may experience greater burdens from current and historical environmental impacts based on income, racial or ethnic identity, or English language isolation factors. (OEJE, 2021, pp. 4,5)\nParticipatory science - members of the public ask questions, collect data, and/or interpret data (EPA, 2025). Example: Chronolog photo sites.\nActive program - event or activity that involves interaction with others or materials. Example: Climate cart.\nPassive program - materials or installations that do not require any interaction with the materials or other people. Example: Harborwalk interpretive signs."
