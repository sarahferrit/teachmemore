    "text": "I was hired by Boston Harbor Now (BHN) to work on this project for 10 weeks during Summer 2025 as a Planning and Policy Fellow through the Harvard Graduate School of Design Community Service Fellowship Program. The results of my work include this online interactive map of existing and recommended climate-related programs along the Boston Harborwalk.\nThis map was created using found data (Flood risk, EJ populations, transit layers) and created layers (existing and recommended climate programs). Sources for the found data are listed below. To catalog the existing climate programs shown, I spoke with BHN and partner staff, conducted desktop research, and visited ## miles of the Harborwalk. To recommend additional programs, I drew inspiration from BHN staff and other cities and programs, made field observations, and conducted a public survey reaching ### people.\nI built the interactive map in RStudio using Quarto markdown and it is hosted on my personal Quarto Pub site.\n\nSources\nCity of Boston.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Boston Harborwalk spans 43 miles of the city’s coastline, passing through many neighborhoods that are vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate such as increased heat and flooding. The Harborwalk itself serves as the edge between communities constructed on human-made land and the Boston Harbor along much of its length, often making this public pathway one of the first structures to experience coastal flooding during high tides or storm surges.\nWith climate concerns becoming more pressing, the purpose of this project is to evaluate what climate-related educational programming is already done along the Harborwalk and to identify opportunities for more. Recommendations for additional climate education programs, activities, and materials prioritize locations and topics that are environmentally and socially relevant for residents and visitors of the Boston Harbor waterfront.\n\n\nMap\nThe following interactive map displays existing and recommended climate-related educational programming along the Boston Harborwalk. This tool may be used by Boston Harbor Now to help guide future programming efforts. Click on a point or polygon to see details about the feature. Toggle layers on or off as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Term Definitions\nClimate programming - events, activities, or materials that cover topics related to climate change like increasing heat, storms, and sea level rise.\nEducational signage - sign or 2-dimensional display with text, graphics, and/or images that intend to educate the public about a topic.\nExisting programming - events, activities, or materials that are currently ongoing or installed, or that took place or are planned to take place in the 2025 calendar year (as of August).\nEnvironmental Justice (EJ) communities - US Census tracts where the population may experience greater burdens from current and historical environmental impacts based on income, racial or ethnic identity, or English language isolation factors.
