# Introduction

The Boston Harborwalk spans 43 miles of the cityâ€™s coastline, passing through many neighborhoods that are vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate such as increased heat and flooding. The Harborwalk itself serves as the edge between communities constructed on human-made land and the Boston Harbor along much of its length, often making this public pathway one of the first structures to experience coastal flooding during high tides or storm surges.

With climate concerns becoming more pressing, the purpose of this project is to evaluate what climate-related educational programming is already done along the Harborwalk and to identify opportunities for more. Recommendations for additional climate education programs, activities, and materials prioritize locations and topics that are environmentally and socially relevant for residents and visitors of the Boston Harbor waterfront.

# Map

The following interactive map displays existing and recommended climate-related educational programming along the Boston Harborwalk. This tool may be used by Boston Harbor Now to help guide future programming efforts. Click on a point or polygon to see details about the feature. Toggle layers on or off as needed.
